# STP Testing Rules

## Test Requirements

### Mode Testing
- All STP modes (PVST+, Rapid-PVST+, MST) must be tested
- Each mode change should include a convergence delay
- Mode verification should handle different output formats
- Test should continue even if one mode fails

### Root Bridge Testing
- Test root bridge election with different priorities
- Verify root bridge status across all VLANs
- Check root port assignments
- Verify root path cost calculations

### Port Configuration Testing
- Test port cost configuration
- Test port priority configuration
- Verify port roles (root, designated, alternate)
- Test port state transitions

### Protection Features
- Test BPDU Guard
- Test Root Guard
- Test Loop Guard
- Verify guard feature status

### Convergence Testing
- Test topology change handling
- Verify convergence time
- Check port state transitions
- Monitor for any loops

## Error Handling
- All test failures must be logged
- Test suite should continue despite individual test failures
- Detailed error messages must be provided
- Test summary must show all pass/fail results

## Output Requirements
- Each test must provide clear pass/fail status
- Error messages must be descriptive
- Test summary must show all test results
- Final status must reflect overall test success/failure

## Verification Methods
- Use appropriate show commands for verification
- Handle different output formats
- Implement flexible pattern matching
- Provide detailed verification results

## Test Flow
1. Test all STP modes
2. Configure and verify root bridge
3. Test port configurations
4. Verify protection features
5. Test convergence behavior
6. Generate test summary

## Success Criteria
- All configured features must be verified
- No STP loops should be detected
- Port states should be correct
- Protection features should be active
- Convergence should complete successfully
